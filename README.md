## Introduction

The House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques project is part of a Kaggle competition where participants are tasked with predicting house prices using regression techniques. In this project, we explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques). It consists of various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with the corresponding sale prices.

## Dependencies

To run the code in this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage

To use this project:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/house-prices-advanced-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd house-prices-advanced-regression
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks to explore the data, preprocess it, build models, and evaluate results:

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Follow the instructions provided in the notebooks to execute each step.

## Results

The predictive models built in this project achieved the following performance metrics:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [MAE Value]
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [RMSE Value]
- R-squared (R2): [R2 Value]

Detailed analysis and visualizations of the results can be found in the project notebooks.
