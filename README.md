Introduction
The House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques project is part of a Kaggle competition where participants are tasked with predicting house prices using regression techniques. In this project, we explore the dataset, preprocess the data, build predictive models, and evaluate their performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle competition House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques. It consists of various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc., along with the corresponding sale prices.
